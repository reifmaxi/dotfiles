# See udiskie(1) for a complete reference.

program_options:
  # Configure defaults for command line options.

  udisks_version: 0
    # [int] Specify the version of udisks to be used. Set to 0 to use automa-
    # tic discovery.

  tray: true
    # [bool] Enable the tray icon. "auto" means auto-hide the tray icon when
    # there are no handled devices.

  automount: false
    # [bool] Enable automatic mounting.

  notify: true
    # [bool] Enable notifications.

  file_manager: ranger
    # [string] Set program to open directories. It will be invoked with the
    # folder path as its command line first argument.

  password_prompt: ["gnome-keyring-query", "get"]
    # [string|list] Set command to retrieve passwords. If specified as a list
    # it defines the ARGV array for the program call. If specified as a string,
    # it will be expanded in a shell-like manner. Each string will be formatted
    # using str.format with a Device object as the first argument. For a list of
    # device attributes, see below. The two special string values "builtin:gui"
    # and "builtin:tty" signify to use udiskie's builtin password prompt.


#mount_options:
  # List of mount option rules. Only the first matching entry is used. Each item
  # can match any combination of device attributes (see below). Additionally, it
  # must define an 'options' list. An item without any device attributes serves
  # as a catch-all rule.

#- id_type: vfat             # match file system type
#  options: ro               # list of mount options
#- id_uuid: 9d53-13ba        # match by device UUID
#  options: [noexec, nodev]  # mount options can be given as list


#ignore_device:
  # Customize udiskie's ignore rules. This config entry has the same structure
  # as *mount_options*, the only difference being that the action is defined by
  # the 'ignore' field which is a boolean defaulting to true. The rules defined
  # here are simply prepended to the builtin ignore rules, so that it is
  # possible to completely overwrite the defaults by specifying a catch-all
  # rule.

#- id_uuid:     abcd-ef01    # ignore this device
#- device_file: /dev/dm-5
#  ignore:      false        # never ignore this device


notifications:
  # Customize which notifications are shown for how long. Possible values are:
  #   positive number         timeout in seconds
  #   false                   disable
  #   -1                      use the libnotify default timeout

  timeout: -1
    # set the default for all notifications

  device_mounted: -1
    # mount notification

  device_unmounted: -1
    # unmount notification

  device_added: -1
    # device has appeared

  device_removed: -1
    # device has disappeared

  device_unlocked:  -1
    # encrypted device was unlocked

  device_locked:    -1
    # encrypted device was locked

  job_failed:       -1
    # mount/unlock/.. has failed

notification_actions:
  # Define which actions should be shown on notifications. Note that there are
  # currently only a limited set of actions available for each notification.
  # Events that are not explicitly specified show the default set of actions.
  # Specify an empty list if you don't want to see any notification for the spe-
  # cified event:

  device_mounted: [browse]
  device_added: [mount]

icon_names:
  # Customize the icon set used by the tray widget. Each entry specifies a list
  # of icon names. The first installed icon from that list will be used.

  media:   [drive-removable-media, media-optical]
  browse:  [document-open, folder-open]
  mount:   [udiskie-mount]
  unmount: [udiskie-unmount]
